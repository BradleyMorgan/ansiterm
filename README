proper setups for viewing ANSI art in xterm and mac os x terminal.app.

includes dos437, a BDF pixel-for-pixel translation of the DOS 437 codepage
font, with a converted TrueType version.


xterm:
convert the BDF font to a PCF font (if necessary) and then install it:
	- bdftopcf dos437.bdf > fonts/dos437.pcf
	- sudo cp fonts/dos437.pcf /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/
	- cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/; sudo mkfontdir

and then run ansiterm.sh to launch xterm with proper colors and the dos437
font.  for tiling window managers, make sure the resulting xterm window is
exactly 80 characters wide.


terminal.app:
install the ttf font (double-click it to open it in font book, and then click
install) and then install the terminal settings profile by double clicking
it.

verify that the font used is dos437 in 8pt, antialias is off, the character
encoding is "western (ascii)", and the terminal is 80x24.


in either xterm or terminal.app, ansi art files should display properly with
cat.
